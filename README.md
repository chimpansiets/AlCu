# AlCu

AlCu is a 48-hour project at Codam Coding college located in Amsterdam.
The aim of the project is to create a game where you have to remove 1-3 matches every turn.
You can only remove matches on one line, and the aim of the game is to NOT remove the last match.
The player who removes the last match loses.

## Getting Started

Run make, and my makefile will compile a binary called "alum1".
run this binary, and you can now specify the field by giving
integers to specify the amount of matches on a row.

e.g.
```
./alum1
5
3
1

Pick an amount of matches to remove (1-3):

Now play against our extreme AI! ;)
